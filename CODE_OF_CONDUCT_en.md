# Epiverse-TRACE Community Code of Conduct

## Overview

Epiverse is a dynamic and inclusive initiative that brings together diverse stakeholders—including epidemiologists, data scientists, software developers, public health professionals and policymakers—to co-create a suite of open-source tools for epidemic preparedness and response. By integrating data analytics, collaborative software development, and capacity-building efforts, Epiverse fosters a thriving community that promotes inclusivity, knowledge sharing, and cross-disciplinary integration within the public health and data science ecosystem.

Our community is our greatest strength, and we prioritize a welcoming environment that celebrates diversity, encourages collaboration, and ensures safety and respect for all participants.

This Code of Conduct outlines our shared values, expected behaviors, and enforcement mechanisms to maintain a safe and enriching space for everyone and applies to: 

* All participants in Epiverse spaces, including staff, collaborators, and leadership.  
* All spaces under the Epiverse umbrella, including GitHub, Slack, mailing lists, online forums, social media, events, and conferences.  
* Both in-person and virtual interactions associated with Epiverse.

## Our Commitment

**We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all participants**, regardless of *gender identity or expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), socioeconomic status, or education level.* We prioritize the safety and well-being of marginalized individuals and communities over the comfort of those in positions of privilege. **Maintaining the integrity and inclusiveness of our community is a shared responsibility.**

We respect the identities and lived experiences of our members and are committed to making our spaces accessible, inclusive, and welcoming. Our goal is to foster an environment where everyone feels encouraged to contribute, ask questions, and engage without fear of judgment or disrespect. We take action against unacceptable behaviors, reinforcing that **no one’s reputation is more important than the safety of our community.**

We recognize that power imbalances exist in all group spaces, including our own. We actively work to acknowledge and minimize their harmful effects.

We know that we will not always get everything right, and we encourage community members to reach out when we fall short. We are committed to learning, adapting, and growing together. 

## Expected Behavior

To create a positive and respectful environment, all community members are expected to:

- Be considerate in speech and actions, acknowledging and respecting boundaries.  
- Remember that people live lives and navigate challenges beyond the confines of the community. Practicing empathy, kindness and respect, always.  
- Engage constructively while asking questions or discussing differing viewpoints.  
- Respect consent in all interactions, including physical and virtual communications.  
- Resolve disagreements and differing views constructively by focusing on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.  
- Support one another by alerting moderators or the Code of Conduct Committee to violations, unsafe situations, or individuals in distress.

Examples of positive behavior include:

- Actively listening to others and valuing their perspectives.  
- Offering constructive feedback in discussions or collaborations.  
- Being mindful of diverse cultural practices and communication styles.  
- Expressing gratitude where we have been supported by the actions, expertise or resources of others.  
- Accepting responsibility for our mistakes, apologising to those affected, learning from the experience and adjusting our behaviour accordingly.

## Unacceptable Behavior

**We do not tolerate harassment in any form.** Adherence to our Code of Conduct requires refraining from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech, including but not limited to:

Harassment and/or discrimination:

* Offensive comments or actions related to gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, appearance, nationality, religion, socioeconomic status, or technology choices.  
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ names.  
* Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes.  
* Unwanted sexual attention or repeated, inappropriate requests for contact.

Abuse, intimidation and threats:

* Stalking, persistent unwanted communication, or tracking online activity.  
* Threats of violence, self-harm encouragement, or incitement to harm others.  
* Disrupting discussions, events, or online conversations.  
* Non-consensual sharing of private messages or recordings.

Unwanted contact and privacy violations:

* Unwanted photography, recording, or personal information sharing.  
* Inappropriate physical or simulated contact (e.g., non-consensual touching, emojis).  
* Pressuring or assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy.

**Our priorities in enforcement**  

Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety and inclusion of marginalized individuals. We recognize that discussions about equity and inclusion can sometimes feel uncomfortable, but we will not prioritize the comfort of those in privileged positions over the well-being of those facing discrimination or exclusion.

This means that we will not take action on complaints that:

* Claim so-called "reverse" discrimination (e.g., “reverse racism” or “reverse sexism”), as systemic inequalities do not operate in reverse.  
* Object to reasonable personal boundaries set by community members, such as requests to end a conversation or disengage.  
* Focus on the tone of someone’s communication rather than the substance of their message.  
* Criticize or challenge someone for speaking up about discrimination, exclusion, or oppressive behavior.

## Reporting and enforcement
