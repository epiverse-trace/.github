# Epiverse-TRACE Community code of conduct

## Overview

Epiverse-TRACE is a global community of members who align around a shared vision of improving the outbreak analytics landscape through the development of scalable, open-source, community-driven software tools. Our community is the heart of the Epiverse initiative. Each and every community member plays a valuable role in our collective success.

We respect the individual identities of our members and we are dedicated to making our spaces accessible, inclusive, and welcoming for all. Our intention is to create spaces where members feel encouraged to contribute safely and to ask questions without fear of judgement or disrespect. We take action against unacceptable forms of behaviour. No one's reputation is more important than the safety of our community members.  

We are conscious of the power imbalances which exist within these and all group spaces. We strive to actively recognise said imbalances and to minimise their harmful effects.

We will not always get it right and we encourage members of the community to reach out and let us know in cases where we miss the mark. We are committed to learning from one another and growing together.

This code of conduct is a living document which is intended to evolve in line with feedback from members of the community. We welcome your input on any element of it. Please do reach out if you have any thoughts and/or suggestions: <conduct@epiverse.org>

## Where and when the code of conduct applies

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing Epiverse-TRACE.

Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event (such as workshops, panel discussions and training activities).

Individuals participating in Epiverse-TRACE events (whether as a trainer, panellist or participant) will be required to adhere to the Code of Conduct upon registering to attend the event.

## Our standards

Examples of behaviour which contribute to a welcoming environment for the community include:

* Remembering that people live lives and navigate challenges beyond the confines of the community. Practicing empathy, kindness and respect, always.
* Assuming good intentions and asking for clarification where there is any uncertainty.
* Being respectful and non-judgemental towards differing experiences or points of view.
* Recognising that everyone's contributions can be valid, independent of title, skill-level or knowledge base.  
* Giving and receiving feedback in a constructive and gracious fashion.
* Reflecting on the impact of our words and actions on others within the community.
* Accepting responsibility for our mistakes, apologising to those affected, learning from the experience and adjusting our behaviour accordingly.
* Expressing gratitude where we have been supported by the actions, expertise or resources of others.

## Unacceptable forms of behavior

Examples of behaviours which are not welcome in our community include (but are not limited to):

* Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact.
* Personal attacks, including derogatory comments, insulting, ignoring, shaming or belittling others.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information without their express permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

The Community Manager and members of the Epiverse-TRACE team are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

The Community Manager and members of the Epiverse-TRACE team have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

The Code of Conduct Committee will determine appropriate enforcement measures on a case-by-case basis. Where practicable, violations to this code of conduct will be addressed informally in the first instance. For example through a verbal or written warning. Repeated or serious violations may result in more sustained ramifications, including a temporary or permanent ban from community spaces (e.g. forums, events) and, where necessary, the involvement of law authorities.

## Reporting

> [!CAUTION]
> Due to high turnover of the team, the information below is out of date and currently being revised.

Incidents can be reported to the Epiverse-TRACE Code of Conduct Committee: <conduct@epiverse.org>

Current membership of the Committee is:

* Anna Carnegie, Community Manager - LSHTM
* Diana Fajardo Pulido, Research Coordinator TRACE-LAC - Pontificia Universidad Javeriana
* Nicolas Yanez, Clinical Data Scientist - Philips Research North America [external Committee Member]
* Natalia Ni√±o, Researcher - Universidad de los Andes
* Claudine Lim, Program Manager - data.org

You may also make a report directly to one member of the Committee by contacting them directly. If any member of the Committee has a conflict of interest with a report, they will be recused and will not have access to the content or process of the report follow-up, which will be handled by the other members of the Committee.

Upon submitting your report, you will receive a copy of your responses via email. You should receive a separate acknowledgement of receipt via email from the Code of Conduct Committee within 48 hours on weekdays, or within 72 hours for an event that takes place on a weekend.

The Committee will investigate your report and follow up according to our Code of Conduct with the aim of making a decision and implementing enforcement as soon as is reasonably possible.

If you would like to report an incident independent of the Epiverse-TRACE reporting mechanism, you can do so using LSHTM's [Report and Support tool](https://reportandsupport.lshtm.ac.uk/), where your concern will be triaged by a member of LSHTM's Equity and Diversity Team.
